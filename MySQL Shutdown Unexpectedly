Copy all folders from the “/xampp/mysql/backup” and paste it to the “/xampp/mysql/data” folder, which you have just created
Copy all the databases from the “/xampp/mysql/data-old” folder and paste it to the “/xampp/mysql/data” folder
Finally copy the “ibdata1” and all of the log files including “ib_logfile0, ib_logfile1 ” from “/xampp/mysql/data-old” and paste it to the “/xampp/mysql/data” folder
